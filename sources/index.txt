===================================
Welcome to zamboni's documentation!
===================================

This is just a start, but imagine how useful real documentation would be for
writing down our conventions, expectations, tips, and a general index of all the
pieces we have available.

While the docs would primarily be a resource for developers, they'd also be
useful for that elusive external contributor.

There's support for automatic module/class/function documentation and tons of
linking goodies.  You can even link to other Sphinx document sites, so we could
reference Django and Jinja docs inline.  It's a little fiddly getting started,
but super awesome once you get the hang of it.

If you're working on the docs, use ``make loop`` to keep your built pages
up-to-date.
