   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to zamboni's documentation!
===================================

This is just a start, but imagine how useful real documentation would be for
writing down our conventions, expectations, trips, and a general index of all
the foundational pieces we have to offer.

While the docs would primarily be a resource for developers, they'd also be
useful for that elusive external contributor.

There's support for automatic module/class/function documentation, and tons of
linking goodies.  You can even link to other Sphinx document sites, so we could
reference Django and Jinja docs inline.  It's a little fiddly getting started,
but super-awesome once you get the hang of it.
