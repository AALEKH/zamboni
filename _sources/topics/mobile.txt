Working on the Mobile Site
==========================

The mobile version of amo expects to be served through `MOBILE_DOMAIN` (the
normal site is served through `DOMAIN`).


Defining domains
----------------

In `/etc/hosts` I have localhost (`127.0.0.1`) aliased to `z` for brevity. Then
I added another `mz` alias for the mobile domain::

    127.0.0.1   localhost z mz

I let zamboni know about all this in `settings_local.py`::

    DOMAIN = 'z'
    SITE_URL = 'http://%s' % DOMAIN
    MOBILE_DOMAIN = 'mz'
    MOBILE_SITE_URL = 'http://%s' % MOBILE_DOMAIN
